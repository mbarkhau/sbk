# KDF: Key Derivation Function

As mentioned in [[User Guide]], the KDF is used to make a brute-force attack expensive and indeed infeasable. It should not be possible for an attacker, even with access to the `salt` (but **without** access to the `brainkey`), to recover a wallet. This means we must make it infeasable to calculate a significant fraction of $`256^{6} = 2^{48}`$ hashes.

With the `sbk.kdf` module we have a few concerns and things we need to accomodate for.

 1. Provide an API for correct use of the `argon2` library.
 2. Encode/decode KDF parameters in compact format.
 3. Implement a meaningful progress meter, so expensive key derivation does not lock up the UI.


## Public API of `sbk.kdf`

```python
# dep: common.types
def digest(
    data       : bytes,
    params     : parameters.Parameters,
    hash_len   : int,
    progress_cb: ct.ProgressCallback | None = None,
) -> bytes:
    ...
```
