# KDF: Key Derivation

As mentioned in [[User Guide]], the KDF is used to make a brute-force
attack expensive and indeed infeasable. It should not be possible for
an attacker, even with access to the `salt` (but **without** access to
the `brainkey`), to recover a wallet. This means we must make it
infeasable to calculate a significant fraction of $`256^{6} = 2^{48}`$
hashes.

With the `sbk.kdf` module we have a two things we need to
accomodate for.

1. Provide an API for correct use of the `argon2` library.
2. Implement a meaningful progress meter, so that the UI can signal to
   the user that expensive key derivation is in progress.


## Public API of `sbk.kdf`

```python
def digest(
    data       : bytes,
    params     : parameters.KDFParams,
    hash_len   : int,
    progress_cb: ct.ProgressCallback | None = None,
) -> bytes:
    ...
```
