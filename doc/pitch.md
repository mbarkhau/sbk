There is moniker in the Bitcoin/Crypto community that goes something like this: If you're not the one or not the only one who has the private keys to your wallet, then you don't own your bitcoin and you're doing it wrong and you should feel bad and you only have yourself to blame if your coins get stolen. 

This advice is fine as far as it goes. It falls short of course in that it doesn't say what a good way is to "be your own bank". You forget your wallet phrase or it gets destroyed: "well, that's just too bad, you should have been more responsible". You used your wallet on a windows machine and your wallet got swept by a virus: "well that's just too bad you shouldn't keep your wallet on an insecure system like windows". You used a paper wallet but for some reason it was empty after you only took a little bit form it, "well that's just too bad, you should have known about change addresses and used better wallet software". 

I view all of this as an tech-elitism or a revenge of the nerds: "You're not tech savey enough to be your own bank? Well tough luck dudebro, I guess you're to stupid to be a part of the crypto revolution. Oh, you're coins got stolen by a frappuccino slurping frenchman? Well tough luck jock, serves you right for trusting the same exchange everybody else was using."

The goal of the SBK project is to be your own bank for mere mortals. In principle it is quite similar to [How Jason Bourne Stores His Bitcoin](http://maxtaco.github.io/bitcoin/2014/01/16/how-jason-bourne-stores-his-bitcoin/) by [Max Krohn](http://maxtaco.github.io/)

The main arguments against this approach are:

 - Why not Multisig
 - [Brute force attack (by wrench)](https://xkcd.com/538/)
 - Loss of access to the SBK software or the Air Gapped Machine (AGM)
    - Perhaps use M-Disc
    - Documentation of Format
