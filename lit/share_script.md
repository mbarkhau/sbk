                                                            Hello, I'm Manuel

                                                            I'm the author of the SBK Project

                                                            SBK is short for "Split Bitcoin Keys" and just in
                                                            case it wasn't obvious from the production quality
                                                            of this video, SBK is an Open Source project.

                                                            Now, you may be watching this video, because you
                                                            have something in your hand that looks like this
                                                            and you just scanned the QR code up here, which
                                                            brought you to this video. The main goal I have
                                                            for the moment is to make sure you have just
                                                            enough information so you at least don't do
                                                            anything wrong with that piece of paper you have
                                                            in your hand. There's plenty more that you might
                                                            want to know about SBK, but for now I just want to
                                                            help you to not make any mistakes.

                                                            Ok, to start with, what is this even. This is
                                                            what's called a "share", as it says "this is one
                                                            share of a Split Bitcoin Key". Now, what you have
                                                            in your hands, might not look exactly what I have
                                                            here; it might be a bit more crude, for example
                                                            instead of being sealed in plastic, it might just
                                                            be stapled together, or it might just be a piece
                                                            of paper that has been folded, or it might be
                                                            something more elaborate, like a set of metal
                                                            plates, such as these dog tags. Whatever yours
                                                            looks like, the first thing you should know is,
                                                            that you should not open it. The person who made
                                                            this may have created some kind of seal that will
                                                            help to protect it from damage and you should
                                                            leave that seal intact. Do not cut it open, no
                                                            matter how curious you are, I promise you the only
                                                            thing you will find inside is a bunch of
                                                            meaningless codes that you won't be able to use
                                                            for anything whatsoever. So just leave the seal
                                                            alone.

                                                            With that very important information out of the
                                                            way, we can continue with just a little context
                                                            about SBK. The basic idea we have somebody who is
                                                            the "Owner" of a Bitcoin wallet and to protect
                                                            their wallet from being lost, they have created a
                                                            backup. This share is one part of that backup,
                                                            it's one piece of a puzzle so to speak, and when
                                                            you put these pieces together again, you can
                                                            recover the original wallet. And when I say you I
                                                            don't mean you, I mean the owner, don't get your
                                                            hopes up, this isn't some kind of lottery ticket.

                                                             Now one of the big selling
                                                            points of Bitcoin is that you have complete
                                                            control of your bitcoin because the only way to
                                                            spend them is if you have access to the wallet. In
                                                            other words, can be your own bank. The flip side
                                                            of that coin is that you're also the only person
                                                            who has the responsibility to maintain control of
                                                            your wallet. In other words, you have to be your
                                                            own bank.
