# Bitcoin is Sovereignty

You have more control over your bitcoin, than anything else in the world. Everything else can be taken from you against your will. Your posessions can be taken from you or destroyed, you can be evicted from your house, you can be thrown in a cage and ultimately you can be killed. There is nothing in your power that can provide an ultimate defence against any of these violations of your physical property. Bitcoin is different. You may well be thretened, somebody may try to extort you, but given some preparation and enough strength of will, nobody other than you can determine what will happen with your bitcoin. Even in the case of your death, you can arrange for them to be passed on according to your will and your will alone.

The promise of Bitcoin is to empower every individual to be sovereign over the fruits of their labor. No matter how weak and alone you are, Bitcoin is the beginning of a world where you are your master and nobody's slave. Bitcoin can deliver people from the shackles of the fiat printing press, the whip that commands their wealth, the leach that drains their life at the push of a button. The power of fiat money inevitabely corrupts those who wield it, even those with the best of intentions. Even if we were assured this power would only ever be wielded by angles, the downfall of central bank administrators is [how little they really know about what they imagine they can design][href_hayek_uoks].

Every person who would like to earn an honest living, save for their retirement and leave something for their children should be free to do so. We will live in a better world if they need not fear theft, be it by crooks, by buerocrats, by rulers or by a plurality of their fellow men. The world will prosper, when any man can cross a border and unlike his forefathers, who would arrive without a penny to their name, carry with him the fruits of his labor and start a new life.

The cliche argument against a crypto nerd, who fantasizes about fanciful cryptographic security, is that the bad guys will knock down his door and break his nuckles until he starts to talk. This attack is a valid concern, but its major flaw is that it does not scale. If bad guys attack an individual they may face a strong willed man, they may second guess themselves if he has plausible deniability, and in any case, it will be expensive for them to scale this attack to everbody who may or may not have lost their bitcoin in a boating accident.

Fanciful language asside, Bitcoin is not a game. SBK is about individual sovereignty. Your keys in your head, but without the risk that your wealth will be lost if you die. With SBK you can cross a border and look just like anybody else, but you carry with you the fruits of your labour. This is a powerful force for freedom in this world then he will have strength in numbers.

## Multi-Signature Wallet

SBK is simple: Something you have and something you know. Multisig is not as simple. You have multiple things, you need to do multiple signatures, ideally on multiple machines in different places. Complexity increases the risk of loss as less technically adept users will shut down more quickly or be more easilly tricked by scammers.

The main use case for SBK is for personal custody of bitcoin.

While multiple people may be involved to provide the distributed backup of your wallet, only you as the owner will have a claim on their bitcoin. If your use-case involves multiple people, with joint custody, you should instead use [n of m multisig][href_btcwiki_multisig] [transactions][href_electrum_multisig].

## SPoF: Single Point of Failure

The single point of failure that remains with SBK is with the recovery process.

## Warp Wallet

SBK has similarities to [warp wallet][href_warp_wallet], except that it has an additional backup using Shamir's Secret Sharing. It is also similar to [Shamir Backup][href_trezorio_shamir_backup] developed by SatoshiLabs s.r.o.[^fnote_disclaimer_satoshilabs], except that it uses a brainkey.

## Witchhunt

Perhaps witch hunting will find a cultural pendant to bring some balance into civil discourse, so that nobody must fear for their livelyhood when they publicly state what they believe to be right. In the meantime, Bitcoin offers a last resort of protection for everybody to fall back on. When your wealth is ultimately protected by your will, and the will of those you trust, rather than by an army of faceless burocrats, who mindlessly execute the supposed "will of the people" or who are just "doing their job" as they declare decades of your lifes work to be null and void or now the property of people that are deemed to be more deserving, then Bitcoin can be the groundswell for a rising tide of soverign people. Bitcoin will be the catalyst for new societies based on networks rather than heirarchies, on the exchange of value for value, rather than on debt and servitude, on competent individuals with natural authority, rather than Moloch and its army of mindless drones with meaningless titles.

You have no greater freedom than the freedom of your thoughts. Move your wealth into your mind and you will be more free than any human in history.
