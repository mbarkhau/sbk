# Trustee 101 - Script

## Intro

There is a good chance that the reason you are watching this is because in your hand you have something like this. You scanned the QR-Code a moment ago, which led you to this video.

## What is it this thing?

Well, in the top left it says "Split Bitcoin Key". The logo uses a puzzle because that is what it is. It's one piece that the owner created as a part of a backup for their Bitcoin. In the center they may have put their contact information. They can use to recover their Bitcoin, for example if their house burns down, their safe is destroyed or if through some other accident the normal way they access their Bitcoin Wallet is no longer possible.

The SBK-Piece you have may not look exactly like this, it may not be laminated, it may not have 
So essentially, this is one piece of a backup to a Bitcoin wallet.

## How does it work

Now if you're not familiar with Bitcoin, you may be surprised that it can be stored on nothing but a piece of paper. In fact there such things as paper wallets. The downside of a paper wallet is that either it has no password protection, in which case anybody who gets a hold of it can also take the Bitcoin, or if it is password protected, then there is a chance that the password will be forgotten or that the paper is destroyed, for example in a fire, in which case the Bitcoin balance of the wallet will be lost forever.

None of this is the case with a Split Bitcoin Key. If you look at the logo, you can see that it is comprised of a puzzle piece and inside it has an embos of the Bitcoin symbol. This gives you an idea that this is just one piece, of perhaps many, that must be combined together again before the bitcoin can be recovered. In other words, there is nothing for you to be excited or worried about if you hold this in your hand, because by itself it is worthless. There is no way to recover the Bitcoin if all you have is this.
